<p>This HTML code has an uncommon error related to the use of the <code>&lt;input type="number"&gt;</code> element and its interaction with JavaScript.  The issue arises when trying to access the value of the input field directly with <code>element.value</code> after changing the value via JavaScript and then attempting to use that new value in a calculation or update.
